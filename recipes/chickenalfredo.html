            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into large cubes or slices</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettucine
                and cook until al dente according to package instructions, usually 10 minutes.
                Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Season chicken breasts with the italian seasoning, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>
                Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet.
                Once it's shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed
                for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon
                of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute.
                Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into
                1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until the butter has melted</li>
            <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth</li>
            <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken</li>
            <li>
                Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettucine noodles</li>
            <li>
                Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish
                with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.
